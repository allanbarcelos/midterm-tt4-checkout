# Checkout Evaluation

This webpage is part of my exam evaluation model, where students can self-assess their performance during the exam and generate a report in PDF format. The purpose of this model is to engage students in the correction process, enabling them to calculate their final grade and compare it with my own evaluation.

## Features

- **Student Information**: Students can enter their code and name to track their submission.
- **Question Scores**: Students provide their score for the exam questions, with scores ranging from 0 to 10.
- **Evaluation Items**: A list of evaluation items where students self-assess their performance using "Yes", "No", or "Partial" options. 
- **Comments**: Students can leave comments explaining their choices.
- **Final Score Calculation**: The final score is calculated based on the answers to the evaluation items, with each answer affecting the final grade.
- **PDF Generation**: After completing the evaluation, students can generate a PDF report with their final score and feedback.

## How it Works

1. Students fill in their details (student code and name).
2. They self-assess each task in the exam by selecting "Yes", "No", or "Partial", and can provide additional comments.
3. Once all items are evaluated, the final score is calculated and displayed.
4. The student can download a PDF containing their score and evaluations.
